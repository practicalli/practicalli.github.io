See the formal selector specification for complete documentation.</p> <p>The following selector patterns should be sufficient to get you started:</p> <ul> <li><code>[:div]</code> Selects all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element nodes.</li> <li><code>[:div.sidebar]</code> Selects all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element nodes with a CSS class of \"sidebar\".</li> <li><code>[:div#summary]</code> Selects the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an HTML ID of \"summary\".</li> <li><code>[:p :span]</code> Selects all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements that are descendants of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements.</li> <li><code>[:div.menu :ul :li :span]</code> Selects only <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with a CSS style of \"menu\".</li> <li><code>[[:div (nth-child 2)]]</code> Selects all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements which are second children of their parent elements.
