### nvim-config-fennel

My initial use of Neovim was to write my own configuration, for which I chose the Fennel language as it was similar to Clojure and the author of Conjure had used Fennel to write it, using Aniseed plugin to make it easier.

The Conjure author updated the approach to using Fennel by creating nfnl which generated lua files from fennel.  I chose not to re-write my config using nfnl as I had found AstroNvim provided far more features with a lot less effort and maintenance.


## Emacs

Emacs has several well-known community build configurations.  Spacemacs is the most used and has the most GitHub stars by a large margin.  Doom Emacs is popular when a very lean experience is preferred or heavy customisation.

As an avid Emacs user when learning the Clojure programming language I wrote a comprehensive book on Software Development with Spacemacs, including a detailed section on Clojure REPL driven development.

### Spacemacs

Spacemacs is a community driven configuration for Emacs with a focus on consitent and discoverable use of all the Emacs features.

[Contributed 35 pull requests](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Apracticalli-johnny){target=_blank} to the Spacemacs project and defined many of the Clojure key bindings.  Also updated the documentation around the use of Magit Forge and Git identity.

Spacemacs remains the go-to configuration for Practicalli as its is so easy to use.
